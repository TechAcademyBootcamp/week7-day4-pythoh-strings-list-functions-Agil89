# String Methods
Write an interactive Python program. This program should read in a person’s name as a string (use input). As output, it should print a greeting followed by the person’s name and then an exclamation mark (!). If the name starts with an “S,” the greeting should be “Howdy.” Otherwise (starts with anything other than “S”), the greeting should be “Hello.” Below are examples of how the script should run: 
Example 1: >>> What is your name? Sam 
Howdy Sam! 
 
Example 2: >>> What is your name? Gary 
Hello Gary!

### Notes:
- Use `startswith()` method of strings
